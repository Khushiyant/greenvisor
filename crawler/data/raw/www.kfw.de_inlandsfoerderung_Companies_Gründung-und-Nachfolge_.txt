Founding and succession
Founding and succession
Our promotional programmes are primarily directed at private individuals who want to start self-employment in Germany. The main place of residence has to be in Germany. However, the promotional programmes are also available to individuals who are already self-employed and to small enterprises that were established only recently. Many business founders and young enterprises lack equity. As a result, the path to self-employment is often blocked from the very beginning. Hardly a bank is willing to grant a loan to a borrower who does not have enough equity. New business founders and young enterprises almost always need small loan amounts and more relaxed collateral requirements for their bank loan. This is where KfW can help.
Financing programmes

What makes this KfW loan so special?
Your bank bears only 20% of the credit risk, KfW bears 80%. This makes it easier for the bank to decide on the loan - provided, of course, your business idea holds the prospect of sustainable economic success.
The loan interest rate is more favourable than for a conventional bank loan; it is fixed for the entire term of up to
10 years
.
On request, two repayment-free years may be granted; that means you only pay interest and start repaying later. We recommend this in cases in which the business cannot be expected to generate profits from the very start.
