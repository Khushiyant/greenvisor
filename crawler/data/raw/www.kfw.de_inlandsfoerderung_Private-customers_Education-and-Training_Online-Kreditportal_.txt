Online loan portal
The online loan portal is the online banking system for your loan.
Your personal access to the online loan portal allows you to manage your loan with ease. You will receive a monthly account statement, providing you with an overview of your account balance. Important messages, such as debit memo notifications, will be sent to your personal mailbox. Should there be any future changes to your address or bank details, you can simply amend them yourself via the portal.
We recommend that you log in to the portal at regular intervals and check your personal details and messages. This is important so that we are able to contact you either via post or email, thus ensuring you do not miss out on any important notifications.
