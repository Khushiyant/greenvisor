KfW supports Syria with reconstruction
Following the fall of the Assad regime, KfW is committed to the stabilisation and reconstruction of Syria. On behalf of the German Federal Government, KfW is providing additional financing and contributes to the country's new start.
In 2024, KfW pledged 79 million euros from the German government's funds. The German government also recently commissioned an additional seven million euros for Syrian civil society projects. Further projects have already been increased in recent months in the context of the refugee movements from Lebanon to Syria.
International Partnerships
KfW's involvement since the beginning of the civil war in 2011 has focussed on crisis management for the people affected and local structures. Implementation was carried out via UN organisations (UNICEF, UNDP, UN-Habitat) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) (Aga Khan Foundation).
Due to the very high demand and its established partnerships and experience, KfW stands ready to continue its ongoing support for the Syrian population and - where relevant and possible - to adapt and expand it to the changed framework conditions, always in close coordination with the German Federal Government.

Current Situation
KfW is closely monitoring developments in Syria following the fall of the Assad regime and is in close dialogue with the German government. According to its eight-point plan, the German government's future support for Syria will be based on the following priorities:
the peaceful transition to an inclusive political system that grants rights and participation to all groups,
coming to terms with the Assad era,
social cohesion,
infrastructure to provide basic services to the population.
Syria Recovery Trust Fund
KfW manages the Syria Recovery Trust Fund (SRTF), which was established in 2013. The commissioning parties are the states of the international community, which pay into the multi-donor trust fund. It contributes to the provision of basic services to the suffering population in the former opposition areas in north-east and north-west Syria. The grant funds are used, for example, to finance projects to provide basic infrastructure such as water, electricity, health services and food.
