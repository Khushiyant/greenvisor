Energy and environment
Particularly in difficult economic times, energy efficiency can make an important contribution to reducing the fixed costs of an enterprise. In order for small and medium-sized enterprises to be able to sustain such investments too, we give particular support to SMEs in the form of low interest rates for loans. In addition, KfW is financing the development of renewable energies, such as electricity and heat from the ground, sun, wind and water.
