network operators kfw has no knowledge of the content of your data transmitted to the social network operators and can not provide any information about what data about you is stored through the use of the respective services the manner which the data from visits to social network pages is used for their own purposes the extent to which activities on the pages are assigned to individual users how long the network operators store this data and whether data from a visit to the pages is passed on to third parties is not conclusively and clearly stated by the respective network operators and is not known to kfw any analysis tools used by the social network operators for kfws account have not been commissioned approved or otherwise supported by kfw any way nor the data obtained from the analysis be made available to it only certain information about social media activity can be viewed by kfw via its account furthermore kfw has no way of preventing or discontinuing the use of such

account navigation under settingshistory and data protection or the menu items listed there with mobile devices smartphones and tablet computers you can use the settings to limit the network operators access to contact and calendar data photos location data etc however this depends on the operating system used risk assessment and data protection impact assessment for the use of social media kfw operates its own online presence on the aforementioned social media channels hereinafter offers on the basis of the provisions of the general data protection regulation hereinafter gdpr kfws offers pursuant to art 35 para 1 gdpr are subject to data protection impact assessment if a form of processing particular when using new technologies is likely to result a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons due to the nature scope circumstances and purposes of the processing kfws own social media services do not trigger the consequence described art 35 gdpr due to the very limited scope of its own data processing see this respect under however some of the posts have a direct personal reference when creating and publishing its own content kfw therefore ensures that addition to the copyright of the photos the image rights of the persons depicted are taken into account if kfw posts refer to other social media users by reposting or mentioning them or show natural persons videos uploaded by kfw only the data that they themselves voluntarily provided be processed however kfws use of social media has effects particularly with regard to the evaluation of data by the respective platform operators for advertising purposes this represents processing for which a data protection impact assessment must be carried out by using a social media account the respective user comes under systematic monitoring by the network operators listed above sensitive data such as political views sexual orientation and health problems can be disclosed which can be linked and used to create a personality profile particularly vulnerable persons such as minors for example can be social media users and therefore may be affected sensitive data may be collected from them too through the collection of log data for example the previously visited websites or the location data of the user this is all the more important as the relevant social networks can not be checked or can only be checked to a limited extent since the data of users based germany is not processed within germany but ireland and third countries the barriers to accessing judicial legal protection are greater than with a company based germany this regard kfw assumes that public bodies that use a social network for public relations and to provide general information have their part of responsibility responsibility this context does not mean that kfw confirms or guarantees the data protection conformity of the products of social media networks it can not do this under the given circumstances instead responsibility means that kfw makes itself and others aware of the risks of social networks social networks currently need to be improved many respects from a data protection perspective this is why social media users are shown alternative more data communication channels by referring to kfws website and legally compliant social media platforms xing and mastodon users are made aware of the risks generally associated with the use of social media kfw has committed itself to these measures its usage concept the advantages and disadvantages of using social media are regularly evaluated taking into account the network operators terms of use social media use is therefore embedded a package of measures against this background kfws assessment of the consequences of its use is as follows a risk identification the risks associated with the use of social media described are essentially independent of kfws own use kfws posts on the offers themselves do not relate to personal data the vast majority of cases but instead their own relevant content is disseminated after all the data processed through interaction with the respective account on social media or other accounts is already publicly accessible or freely available on the internet however through its appearance on kfws respective offer and the interrelationship the content is made available to a wider more specific public and may therefore attract greater attention and further dissemination than without this interaction the fact that kfw connects with other accounts on social media creates additional cross connections and information about the respective user of the account finally log data is collected by the respective platform provider when the user passively reads the page there is a risk of identity theft discrimination reputational damage financial loss or disclosure of sensitive data b risk analysis the expansion of the distribution range and the enlargement of the link options favours the processing of the data for other purposes by the operator of the respective social media network and a secret profiling openness to visitor posts can lead to adverse social consequences such as inappropriate or discriminatory comments or the dissemination of sensitive data although these damages may be considered to be material when caused by the respective platform operator they only be increased to a very limited extent by the respective offer from kfw since the respective posts are published elsewhere there is no compulsion to participate one of the social media networks c risk assessment the risk assessment is based on the criteria of the severity of the damage and the probability of occurrence overall the additional risk caused by the offers can be classified as low to medium kfw actively contributes to further reducing risk this includes particular providing information about kfws respective privacy notice and the alternative offer provided the data subjects are free to choose which form of information source they wish to operate and use however the majority of these measures lie within the users sphere of influence for example there is no obligation to use your real name when using social media addition the users can protect themselves to a certain extent through various options such as deleting their browser history deactivating cookies and not sharing their location when using photos addition continuous editorial support enables kfw to intervene the event of any slanderous or defamatory comments up to and including blocking the account of the disruptive user d conclusion kfws offers on the social media channels mentioned are justifiable view of the risks described and the binding measures stipulated kfw undertakes to monitor further developments and if necessary to repeat and further develop the appraisal carried out here alternative information and contact options we would like to point out to users that the kfw social media profiles are only additional option for contacting or receiving information from kfw group alternatively the information offered via kfw social media profiles can be accessed via the corresponding links on our website
