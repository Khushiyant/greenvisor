hydrogen all over the world technologies for sustainably transforming sectors that can not be electrified include the use of hydrogen produced with renewable electricity commonly referred to as green hydrogen power to x technologies which convert wind or solar power into raw materials and energy sources that can be used for example the chemical and steel industries are gaining prominence significant additional renewable power generation capacity is needed to produce the required amounts of and fuels given the limited areas potentially available for renewable expansion germany and even europe along with more favourable conditions other countries a significant share of the green gases and fuels needed need to be sourced from abroad the long term kfw concludes contracts with state actors other countries on behalf of the federal ministry for economic cooperation and development order to initiate the development of a sustainable hydrogen economy these programmes promote the production and use of green hydrogen and its secondary products such as vehicles and sustainable fuels as a result they improve profitability and increase the interest of other private investors finances projects of german and european industry that are leaders the field of green technologies these include electrolysers manufactured germany which are the heart of hydrogen production as well as infrastructure for transport and facilities for storing hydrogen addition capital is provided for goods and facilities across various industries that use green hydrogen such as trains or plants for producing green steel advises and finances companies and projects worldwide the field of green hydrogen production and use feasibility studies for projects the area of green hydrogen are prepared kfws ptx platform kfw has launched the ptx platform to bundle kfws diverse promotional and financing instruments this shop coordinates and implements financing for projects along the entire value chain it aims to promote ptx projects which would not yet pass banking requirements especially developing countries and emerging economies as easily as possible order to close existing financial gaps more about the ptx platform ptx development fund developing countries and emerging economies addition to good framework conditions targeted government support is required to establish ptx technology on industrial scale and worldwide this is because the green hydrogen economy is characterised by global value creation and trade networks with substantial involvement from developing countries and emerging economies further financing from kfw group complements the promotion of the development fund this provides optimal support for countries the global south to pilot this crucial future technology and accelerates its global market adoption further information on the development fund examples of projects worlds largest hydrogen project the worlds largest plant for producing green hydrogen is currently under construction saudi arabia kfw is contributing usd 325 million to the financing through its subsidiary kfw the electrolysers from the renowned german manufacturer thyssenkrupp nucera are a key component of the project the plant produce green ammonia on industrial scale after its planned completion 2026 with its own wind and solar farms and covers the entire value chain from renewable energy generation right through to exportation to europe and asia further information building a green hydrogen economy south africa kfw has launched a programme to develop a sustainable hydrogen economy with the south african promotional bank this includes reference projects for the production and use of green hydrogen and its secondary products such as buses sustainable aviation fuel and green ammonia kfws support contribute to the economic development of south africa and create jobs further information uzbekistan facilitating the decarbonisation of the economy through its subsidiary deg kfw is supporting the development of the first green hydrogen plant uzbekistan and providing a loan of usd 25 million the plant is expected to produce tonnes of green hydrogen per year and is powered by green energy from expanded wind farm facility uzbekistans green hydrogen strategy aims to decarbonise heavy industry and supports commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the share of renewable energies the energy mix to further information further information kfw development bank on behalf of the german government we improve
