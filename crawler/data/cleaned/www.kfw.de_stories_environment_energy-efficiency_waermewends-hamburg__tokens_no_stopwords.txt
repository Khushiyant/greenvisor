protection principles if you click on one of the following icons your data be sent to the corresponding social network privacy information hamburg is currently reaching key milestones as it undergoes a sustainable heating transition one of the largest pipeline networks germany is already increasingly supplied with exhaust heat from industrial companies and the east of the city the planned transformation of the tiefstack energy park be another important step on the road to climate neutrality by just sight of the elbphilharmonie the east of hamburg lies the aurubis ag plant the company is europes largest copper manufacturer and has developed a flagship project that has been successfully supplying entire district with almost exhaust heat for several years now together with the energy supplier enercity ag from lower saxony a pipeline built that runs for close to four kilometres from the aurubis plant under one of the elbe bridges to the hafencity the east since then more than households have been supplied with green heating energy transition the private building sector germany more and more homeowners are currently undergoing their private energy transition with a solar system on the roof battery storage and a heat pump the basement and perhaps a wallbox for electric car german with english subtitles source kfw detlev karres thomas schuch innovative technology intermediate absorber the new intermediate absorber a chemical process takes place which heat is released this heats water to a temperature of over 90 degrees via a heat exchanger aurubis first had to build a new intermediate absorber this colossus weighs over 250 tonnes is 18 metres high and has a diameter of six metres chemical processes that take place here generate large amounts of exhaust heat that previously cooled down the river elbe completely unused with the intermediate absorbers innovative technology it has been possible to feed the hot water directly into the new pipeline for the hafencity subsidies however the pioneering project only perfected when the federal ministry for economic affairs and climate action bmwk and kfw as promotional partner agreed to provide financial support all those involved at early stage agreed without the promotion the exhaust heat project could not have been implemented this form with repayment grants from the kfw energy efficiency programme exhaust heat today federal funding for energy efficiency commerce aurubis able to finance the necessary plant conversion heat extraction and the internal line up to the plant boundary at low cost funding provided for the heat transport pipeline of the project partner enercity ulf gehrckens has been working for many years as a manager for energy and climate action at the metal group aurubis aurubis manager ulf gehrckens involved the exhaust heat project from the very beginning kfw made a very important contribution to this project this project needed grants and it not possible to get those grants directly there had to be a bank between and kfw stepped to provide the funding blueprint for the municipal heat transition harald lesch is a professor at lmu munich and lecturer natural philosophy at the munich school of philosophy he is a book author and presenter of science programmes for professor harald lesch the physicist and renowned scientific journalist leschs kosmos and terra x the project hamburg could serve as a blueprint for many other cities germany transporting industrial exhaust heat into a residential area is once again one of those projects where you could say why havent we been doing this before every machine produces heat every process industry releases heat and at a copper plant heat is naturally available excess we have energy source here and now all we need is pipes that bring this energy to where it is needed and of course if almost revolutionary project like this one should be launched kfw as institution is demand there has to be someone to finance this at the beginning and thats what kfw does the future of the heating transition exhaust heat project a new exhaust heat project by aurubis ag and hamburger energiewerke completed january however the deal wasnt perfect until kfw and the federal ministry for economic affairs and climate action pledged their support everyone agrees that without the funding the district heating project would not have been carried out with repayment bonuses financed by the federal ministry from the kfw energy efficiency programme waste heat nowadays federal funding for energy and resource efficiency the economy aurubis able to fund the necessary plant conversion heat extraction and internal pipeline up to the site perimeter more funding provided for the heat transport pipeline of the project partner enercity since then the aurubis waste heat has been fed into the hanseatic citys district heating network which is over 860 kilometres long to this end hamburger energiewerke has built a new pipeline from the pressurised heat storage facility on georgswerder damm to the transfer station on spaldingstrasse more than households be supplied with green exhaust heat future through increased use of industrial exhaust heat it be possible to save up to tonnes of carbon emissions each year the new exhaust heat project hamburg is currently one of the largest of the heating transition germany tiefstack energy park transformation hamburg intends to phase out coal by 2030 at the latest by this date the power plant tiefstack energy park have been transformed the use of the aurubis exhaust heat is important building block for the gradual transformation of the tiefstack energy park here the existing power plant first be converted into a plant that generate heat based on biomass gas and later hydrogen by 2030 at the latest other components include exhaust heat recovery from the existing waste incineration plant as well as a new plant with which it soon be possible to feed hot water into the district heating network via electrode boiler due to heat storage system it be possible to provide the heat at any time when it is needed the new tiefstack energy park by the end of the decade two new types of river heat pumps be used to extract heat from the elbe river these are set to contribute the largest share of heat to the tiefstack energy park future after completion the two heat pumps supply around households with green heat producing a combined output of around 230 megawatts river heat pumps heat from rhine water the largest river water pump on the rhine has been operating on the site of the power plant mannheim since october the currently largest river heat pump went into operation successfully october 2023 mannheim on the rhine the xxl heat pump works principle the same as a normal air source heat pump instead of heat from the air the river power plant only uses rhine water the water coming from the river heat pump is as hot as 99 degrees it is part of the district heating supply operated by the mannheim utility company mvv energie ag the river heat pump which costs around eur 15 million is located on the site of the power plant mannheim the south of the city the heat goes directly into the district heating network and currently supplies green heat for households the planned hamburg models even exceed this output many times over support from kfw the river heat pump mannheim supported by the iku investment loan for municipal and social enterprises 148 read more german only the mannheim river heat pump developed by the bmwk as part of the 7th energy research programme as a real laboratory of the energy transition with federal and eu funds addition state loans from the kfw programme 148 were included the project financing via bayernlb a much larger heat pump is currently being planned downstream cologne rheinenergie ags river heat pump be then the largest europe and with a heat output of 150 megawatts supply tens of thousands of households the cathedral city with green heat municipal heat transition district heating expansion the expansion of district heating networks is essential for the future heating supply all heating networks are to be climate neutral by germany has set itself the goal of being by around 60 of final energy consumption is currently attributable to the heating sector the transformation of the heating sector is therefore essential by at the latest all of the around municipalities germany are to have heating planning by 30 june 2026 large cities inhabitants and more and two years later municipalities with fewer than inhabitants smaller municipalities fewer than inhabitants can use a simplified heat planning procedure which is decided upon by the federal states the german federal government has laid the legal foundations for comprehensive municipal heating planning district heating particular play important role the future heat supply existing heat networks be further expanded and gradually converted to supply heat from renewable energies by 2045 all heating networks must therefore be since 1 january 2024 new heating networks have been required to supply at least 65 of their heat from renewable energy sources by 2030 half of the pipeline heat is to be generated a manner with 30 of the heating the networks set to come from renewable energies or industrial exhaust heat by 2040 this figure is set to stand at as the federal governments digital transformation and promotional bank kfw is making it possible for municipalities companies and private individuals to achieve the ambitious goal of making germany by the example of hamburg impressively shows how a municipal heating transition can be successful with targeted promotion of innovative and measures published on kfw stories on 15 april 2025 updated on 8 april 2025 the described project contributes to the following united nationsʼ sustainable development goals goal 9 build resilient infrastructure promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation or dilapidated infrastructure hinders economic efficiency and thus engenders poverty when building infrastructure the focus should be on sustainability for example by promoting means of transport factories and industrial facilities should ensure that production is line with ecological aspects to avoid unnecessary environmental pollution goal 11 make cities inclusive safe resilient and sustainable as things stand half of the worldʼs population already lives cities yet cities fuel global warming they are responsible for 70 per cent of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions heavy traffic intense construction activity with a massive urban sprawl high energy requirements and enormous amounts of waste and wastewater all of these things come together cities however the density of cities makes them the ideal starting point for combating climate change this is because they can protect resources on a large scale and act as a sustainability template for example by using and compact urban structures traffic systems buildings and regulated waste disposal goal 12 ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns humanity has long lived beyond its ecological means this applies particular to industrial countries and the growing upper and middle classes many emerging economies the transition to economic strategy and way of life that respects the natural limitations of our planet can only be successful if we adjust our consumption habits and production techniques internationally valid rules for labour health and environmental protection are important for this goal 13 take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts water shortages droughts hurricanes and floods are just a few of the many consequences of global climate change and causes of migration around 20 million people are currently being forced to leave their homes as a result of events climate change does not stop at national borders and its effects are not limited to individual policy areas economic sectors or social groups international efforts to contain climate change must take into account the
