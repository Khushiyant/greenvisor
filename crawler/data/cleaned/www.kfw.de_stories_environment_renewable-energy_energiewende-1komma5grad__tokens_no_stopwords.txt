homeowners are currently undergoing their private energy transition with a solar system on the roof battery storage and a heat pump the basement and perhaps a wallbox for electric car digital connectivity and the use of artificial intelligence create unprecedented opportunities to make the transformation the building sector much smarter and cheaper climate goal the climate policy requirements to meet the 2015 paris climate goal to limit the increase global warming to average of degrees and the energy crisis have significantly increased the interest of private individuals clean and affordable energy production particular without fossil fuels addition to energy production refurbishment of existing buildings and the construction of new buildings continue to be essential tools for effectively reducing energy consumption and decarbonisation this area energy transition the private building sector germany more and more homeowners are currently undergoing their private energy transition with a solar system on the roof battery storage and a heat pump the basement and perhaps a wallbox for electric car german with english subtitles source kfw detlev karres thomas schuch decentralised energy generation and digitalisation claudia kemfert is professor of energy economics and energy policy at the university of lüneburg and heads the energy department at the german institute for economic research diw berlin she is of the german advisory council on the environment for the federal government the renowned energy economist dr claudia kemfert sees decentralised energy generation and smart digitalisation the private building sector particular as the decisive step on the way to a decarbonised future the aim of the energy transition is to expand as many renewable energies as possible this means that decentralisation is important as much solar energy as possible on the roofs at the same time it must be a question of the heating transition replacing oil and gas heaters with for example a heat pump or alternatives to ensure these changes are made wisely we need a decentralised solution digital intelligent and smart interest decentralised energy supply solutions is growing and with it the number of technologies for effectively using renewable energies our own homes order for the power generation of a solar installation to be used as efficiently as possible the individual components of this type of supply solution must be optimally coordinated with each other this task is performed by energy management system ems that records and optimises all energy flows the household cleantech recent years dynamic have established themselves germany particular they use innovative technologies to reduce negative environmental impacts the building energy sector and help to use sustainable resources more efficiently these climate protection technology companies better known as cleantech have specialised different business models that pave the way for their customers to affordable and energy production especially among the the experiencing particularly some are on the best path to achieving or have already achieved the coveted status of a unicorn these unicorns are young companies with estimated value of at least usd 1 billion there are currently just over 30 unicorns germany 1komma5grad heartbeat ai is the name of the main platform at 1komma5grad artificial intelligence ai is used to update the energy management system which networks all components the house and keeps them up to date at all times via software updates one of these young cleantech even bears the paris climate goal its name 1komma5 from hamburg is the process of fundamentally changing the market for solar installations battery storage heat pumps wallboxes energy management systems and the affordable procurement of electricity from renewable energies and thus significantly advancing the heating transition the building sector within just about two years the has developed into one of the rare unicorns the country it is now expanding to six more countries denmark sweden finland spain the netherlands and australia 1komma5 sees itself as a carbon reduction company thanks to the comprehensive networking of all connected components and the intelligent algorithm of the energy management system heartbeat the electrical energy consumption of its customers is shifted to times when there is a surplus of electricity from renewable energies philipp schröder philipp schröder founded 1komma5grad together with three companions previously he a member of the management board of tesla germany and the then independent battery manufacturer sonnen gmbh from the allgäu region before philipp schröder developed the idea and vision for 1komma5 consultation with his jannik schall micha grüber and philip liesenfeld he already brought a wide range of industry experience to the table as ceo schröder previously worked the electric car and battery storage sectors for over ten years his three colleagues gained comparable knowledge and experience before the founded for philipp schröder the intelligent networking of the various components is one of the keys to the success of his company we have to put together different pieces of the puzzle bringing together craftsmanship new hardware technology and software and thats where we make our contribution to digital transformation 1komma5grad founded 2021 as a cleantech hamburg the company is now represented at over 80 locations with around employees seven countries europe and australia website 1komma5grad addition to the desired business success schröders and his teams own contribution to the paris climate goal of degrees which is the inspiration for the rather unusual company name remains the overarching guiding principle germany the building stock which is predominantly heated with fossil fuels such as oil and gas is currently still responsible for around 30 per cent of all carbon emissions the legislators aim is for the sector to be almost by to achieve this 1komma5 and the other cleantech companies such as enpal thermondo zolar and many more must transform millions of buildings within around 20 years kfw supports the energy transition for kfw executive board member melanie kehr compliance with the paris climate goal is decisive for whether the road to a germany by 2045 still be successful time is running out as 2024 already the first year which the world missed this target for the average temperature for the first time this is a huge challenge for us at kfw and i particularly pleased that we are not only talking about doing without here the population the economy but can use digitalisation and technology to create the path to a country the 1komma5grad business model is ultimately profitable for the customer melanie kehr kfw executive board member and chief information officer cio addition melanie kehr who is a volunteer member of the board of directors of the digital industry association known as the federal association for information technology telecommunications and new media bitkom is particularly impressed by the fact that 1komma5 is a young from germany that is already growing at above average rate and is consistently using digitalisation and artificial intelligence to overcome the specific challenges of the heat transition a particularly positive aspect of this business model is that the customers benefit as the monthly operating costs are significantly reduced and the investment costs pay off within a reasonable period of time addition the personal contribution to the urgently necessary decarbonisation is remarkable conversely founder philipp schröder sees kfw as a decisive factor on the way to germanys sustainable transformation our view kfw plays a very special role germany because whether were talking about the mobility transition the heat or the energy transition it is always associated with initial investments to get out of oil gas and coal and these initial investments need to be financed of course kfw helps two ways one is that almost everyone has the opportunity to receive very favourable interest rates to finance the acquisition costs and the other point is that we can see that there are balanced social concepts there where the grants are high that the effectiveness the cost reduction is already being achieved within the first few years digitalisation of the craft integration of the craft for the success of the joint business idea the close cooperation of formerly independent tradespeople with software and sales specialists is essential the jointly developed business idea to become a system provider for energy solutions the integration of formerly independent specialist trade companies played a key role from the outset this is because the installation of system components on the roofs and the basements of private or houses as well as commercial buildings can only be carried out by skilled craftsmen 1komma5 has therefore taken over a few dozen craft companies with their specialists at the most important locations throughout germany and cooperates with others to ensure the sale installation and maintenance of the various components from a single source the advantages for all parties involved are obvious the energy management system manages the electricity consumption of 1komma5 customers that they always pay the cheapest price per kilowatt hour even a large trade company can not develop ai system like that by itself the orders for solar systems heat pumps battery storage systems and other components are bundled for the acquired craft companies and thus purchased more cheaply for all parties involved principle 1komma5 thus unites three companies under one roof we are a craft company a software supplier and a virtual power plant operator explains philipp schröder virtual power plant networking of all components by networking the solar installation heat pump battery storage electric car and smart meter gateway of all customers a separate virtual power plant is created the creation of a virtual power plant is a key objective of 1komma5 thanks to artificial intelligence existing solar systems heat pumps battery storage systems and customers electric cars are networked to form a virtual currently only around systems with a capacity of just under 450 megawatt hours mwh are networked by the end of the decade 1komma5 plans to achieve annual capacity of at least gigawatt hours gwh for some years now consumers have been able to simultaneously purchase electricity and feed energy into the grid with a solar system with the energy and heating transition the old separation between producers and consumers of electricity is being overcome for more and more people the energy sector this has made a type of prosumer possible this term combines producer and consumer prosumers are people who both produce and consume techlab berlin testing lab the techlab all components are optimised and further developed together with the software under conditions at the recently opened development centre 1komma5 tests its entire product range from heat pump and wallbox control to battery storage and solar system optimisation and energy management systems under conditions various weather conditions generation and consumption profiles as well as electricity market situations can be digitally simulated here order to precisely test and further develop the technology app analysis the consumer can use their smartphone or tablet to clearly track all energy flows their household effective app that clearly displays all energy flows to consumers on smartphones or tablets is now standard with most providers the app determines the output costs or yield of the solar installation heat pump and other components at any time and anywhere with internet connection a special highlight of the 1komma5 app is the readout of the cumulative carbon savings achieved by the system on a daily basis through energy production and consumption for the household smart meters entry into the world of smart electricity access to the smart grid is only possible via the digital electricity meter and the smart meter gateway intelligent electricity meters known as smart meters are essential for the success of the energy transition the electricity market the black ferraris meter analogue device has been installed germany for over 100 years a smart meter on the other hand is a digital electricity meter that automatically encrypts the data and transfers them to the smart grid via the smart meter gateway however smart meter coverage german households is currently only close to one per cent while countries such as sweden denmark and finland are already equipped with smart meters nationwide the low number of smart meters german buildings compared to the nordic countries has the negative consequence that only relatively few consumers can currently benefit from the significant advantages of a flexible electricity market from 2025 the installation of smart meters be mandatory germany for the first time for households with annual electricity consumption of more than kwh with larger solar systems a heat pump or a wallbox for electric cars by 2025 however all households have the right to install intelligent electricity meter and thus access the flexible electricity market dynamic electricity tariffs flexible electricity market the flexibilisation of the german electricity market and the expansion of renewable energies is leading to increasing supply of cheap and electricity but to systemic price fluctuations with the dynamic electricity tariff the price per kilowatt hour kwh is flexibly based on the current market value this means that the electricity price fluctuates hourly or daily like a share price depending on supply and demand on the leipzig electricity exchange european energy exchange eex this allows households to use electricity at times when it is cheaper since 1 january 2025 all electricity providers germany have had to offer a dynamic tariff households with dynamic electricity tariffs not only benefit from flexible electricity prices but from flexible grid tariffs the steady expansion of renewable energies recent years has led to increasing supply of affordable and electricity overall at the same time however price fluctuations have increased fact significantly higher prices can occur on the electricity exchange times of comparatively low supply of electricity from renewable energies the case of dynamic tariffs providers pass these on directly to their customers the significant price risks that can arise for example phases of a dunkelflaute or dark doldrums when only a few hours of sun and wind are available over a longer period of time are automatically mitigated by intelligent energy management systems for the customer the artificial intelligence takes into account weather data and the hourly prices of the electricity exchange it recognises consumption patterns the household and can then predict the required amounts of electricity both consumption and production this way it optimises private energy consumption and costs very soon decentralised electricity storage systems germany with much higher capacities do much a better job compensating for the natural fluctuations electricity generation with renewable energies this allows the electricity to be stored for longer periods of time to bridge times of low generation previously the already installed storage systems with a capacity of gigawatts were mainly used to stabilise the grid the energy market the short term smooth out load peaks or bridge the time until conventional power plants gas and coal could be fired up further large battery storage units be completed germany this year and significantly more are already firmly planned for the coming years which multiply the total capacity the foreseeable future this could for example make the construction of new power plants as a reserve capacity superfluous battery storage energy storage unit with intelligently controlled energy storage unit electricity is temporarily stored and can be used later with a time delay a battery or electricity storage unit is a useful component for temporarily storing or surplus electricity until it is required if on the other hand there is more electricity demand than your own solar system can supply for example at night or during times the electricity generated on the roof can be used with a time delay by discharging the battery storage with a dynamic electricity tariff a smart meter and intelligent energy management system the battery is always charged with grid electricity from renewable energies when it costs the least on the electricity exchange heat pumps combination with electricity from a solar installation a battery storage system intelligent energy management system and a dynamic electricity tariff a modern heat pump can be operated the short term much more economically and than any comparable system based on fossil fuels the most commonly installed heat pump is not only essential from the perspective of cleantech companies for a heating transition the private building sector the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems ise freiburg has calculated that heat pumps generate up to of heat from 1kwh of electricity a much higher efficiency than for example the most modern oil and gas heaters heat pumps that use electricity from renewable energies heat with virtually zero emissions heat pumps combination with electricity from a solar installation a battery storage system intelligent energy management system and a dynamic electricity tariff a modern heat

pumps use about 75 environmental energy and 25 electricity to produce one kilowatt hour of heat controlled by intelligent energy management system heat pumps can even take the strain off the grid by using excess power and balancing peaks for many millions of private homes germany that are currently still heated with fossil energy there are savings potential of several billion tonnes of carbon emissions the medium and long term which can hardly be overestimated financing for venture capital kfw capital invests german and european venture capital funds which turn invest companies their growth phases germany thereby strengthening the capital base of these companies read more successful such as 1komma5 and others are particularly dependent on venture capital from vc investors during the intensive growth phase kfw capital kfws vc fund investor is invested 1komma5 via the german vc fund ecapital based münster with a focus on technology recent years support from the future fund and kfw capital has significantly facilitated access to venture capital germany by 2030 the german federal government provide eur 10 billion and thus leverage private investment addition the growth fund germany is endowed with eur 1 billion and is already invested around 25 vc funds future fund annual status report 2024 kfw prepares annual status report on behalf of the federal government german only download for 1komma5 ceo philipp schröder the commitment of the german federal government and kfw to venture capital is of decisive importance for a successful transformation it is absolutely essential that germany becomes even better when it comes to venture capital we ourselves are delighted to have kfw indirectly as investor 1komma5 as well that is why it is all the more important that the state sends a signal through kfw that investors this area have the state as a on their side we believe that it is very very important that we can keep up with the americans there together with the other european competitors especially france this is a very important signal this respect too kfws role is really important win initiative signing of the win initiative from left to right oliver bäte ceo allianz christian sewing ceo deutsche bank stefan wintels ceo kfw and dirk schmitz blackrock at the signing of the win initiative berlin september with the win initiative growth and innovation capital for germany alliance of business associations politics and kfw to promote innovation and venture capital another important driving force for the german landscape has emerged win intends to provide at least a further eur 12 billion for the german venture capital ecosystem before the end of this decade win initiative kfw is coordinating the win initiative on behalf of the german federal government kfw is involved the win initiative with its own commitment particularly the areas of cleantech the win package of measures aims to provide special financing solutions for building up industrial production capacities accordingly the federal government wants to examine how private investors can be mobilised through public support for example through kfw order to close existing gap this segment this might already lay the foundation for the next german unicorn published on kfw stories on 13 february 2025 updated on 28 february the described project contributes to the following
