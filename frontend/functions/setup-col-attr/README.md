# setup-col-attr

## üß∞ What does this function do?

This function is designed to automate the setup of your Appwrite database schema for the Greenvisor app. It programmatically creates all required attributes (fields) and indexes for the `users` collection in the `greenvisordb` database, based on the finalized building setup form schema. This ensures your Appwrite collection is always up-to-date and ready for use by the frontend.

- **Creates all required attributes** (string, integer, boolean, array, etc.) for the building setup form.
- **Creates recommended indexes** for efficient querying.
- **Idempotent:** Safely skips attributes or indexes that already exist, so it can be run multiple times without error.
- **Logs** each step for easy troubleshooting.

## üß∞ Usage

### POST /

- Triggers the setup: creates all attributes and indexes for the `users` collection in the `greenvisordb` database.
- Returns a JSON response indicating success or any errors.

**Sample `200` Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Attributes and indexes created (or already exist)."
}
```
